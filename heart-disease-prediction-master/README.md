# Predicting and Analyzing Heart Disease with Machine Learning

This project is the capstone assignment for the spring 2019 [Data Science course]. It aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using binary classification machine learning algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression , Decision tree) and a dataset of patient information, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).
